Done Since last Push:



- Use an Enum and not an String for the different kinds of Platoon Callbacks for the MessageQueue (see FSM)
- uiScaling is weird.
- have a UnitUI class and it has it's own fsm?
	- This Class may hold all the logic for updating the unitUI bases on the Unit's state?
- Implement the Platoon-System (Trivial Boid) (Messages)
	- Try some Boiding for the Units!
	- Test it with way more Units (15 vs. 15?)
- Get 3 Unit Archetypes to test Platoon
- UI at the Ant-Hive to create new Units (and decrease Food)
- Food-Places to collect Food
- Workers
- Change Input querry#s to use the Unity Input Manager
- Platoons: Formation Slots? Every Unit has a specified Formation Slot? and then the Unit in the Slot is moved?


Quality of Life:
- It's weird that everytime i add a Unit I have to add the UI to the script public variable "uiCanvas".
	- As the UI is a unique think this might be able to be added via script not editor.
- The UnitUI Corrently only works iff the anchorpoint of it's parent is in the bottom-left corner. should compensate for the offset of the parents
